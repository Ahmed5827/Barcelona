  <!--
    THE DEFINITIVE SOLUTION:
    - No fixed height (h-96) is ever used.
    - On large screens, we set a MINIMUM height (lg:min-h-96).
    - This means the card will be AT LEAST 96 units tall on desktop, but will
      dynamically grow taller if the text needs more space. This is the
      best of both worlds.

      <img src="/barca.jpg" alt="FC Barcelona" class="w-full h-full object-cover" />
    </figure>

    <!--
      - We vertically center the content (justify-center). This works now because the
        card's height is always correct for its content, or larger on desktop,
        so nothing will ever be pushed out of view.
